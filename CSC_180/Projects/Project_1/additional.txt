Additional Features Implemented
In addition to analyzing customer reviews, I incorporated the following features into the predictive model:
Latitude and Longitude: These geographical coordinates provide context about the business's location, which can influence customer ratings based on regional preferences and competition.

Review Count: The total number of reviews received by a business serves as a quantitative indicator of its popularity and customer engagement. This feature helps the model understand the relationship between the volume of feedback and overall ratings.

By integrating these additional features, the model aims to capture a more accurate view of the factors influencing business ratings, improving its predictive capability.
